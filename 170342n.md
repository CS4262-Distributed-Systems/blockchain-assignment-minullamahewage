# Blockchain Concepts
1. **Smart contracts**

It is a program in Hyperledger fabric deployed in packages called *chaincode* which contains the business logic that governs assets on the blockchain ledger. Before chaincode is deployed, members of the channel need to agree on the chaincode definition.

2. **Permissioned and Permissionless Blockchains**

In a permissionless blockchain, anyone is allowed to participate and it is open. Anonimity is ensured. Therefore there is an inherent lack of trust. To overcome this certain transactions fees are employed. 

In a permissioned blockchain, the blockchain is operated among a group of known participants. Due to there being a certain level of trust among the participants, permissionless blockchains can use traditional crash fault tolerent (CFT) or byzantine fault tolerant (BFT) consensus protocols that do not require costly mining.
